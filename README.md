## about me
- Hi, Iâ€™m @jrerkens but please just call me Jimmy!
- I'm a Ph.D. student in Anthropology at Boston University
- I graduated from The Ohio State University with a degree in Statistics and Anthropology
- There, I completed my undergraduate Honors thesis: _Facial fluctuating asymmetry in three species of colobus monkeys_ and also did some dental anthropology work concerning chacma babooons
- I'm interested in researching anthropogenic stress among populations of vervet monkeys (hopefully on St. Kitts!) but within my analysis I prefer to work within a Bayesian paradigm
- One of my goals is to make Statistics more approachable <3 please feel free to reach out, I love collaboration!
